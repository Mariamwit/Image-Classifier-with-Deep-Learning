# Image-Classifier-with-Deep-Learning 

<h1>  Image-Classifier-with-Deep-Learning and Building a Command Line Application  </h1>



<h2> Project Description</h2>
In this project, an image classifier is trained to recognize different species of flowers.It implements an image classifier with PyTorch. The project is broken down into multiple steps:Loading and preprocessing the image dataset, training the image classifier on your dataset, and using the trained classifier to predict image content. After building and training a deep neural network on the flower data set, it is converted into an application. The application is a pair of Python scripts that run from the command line.
